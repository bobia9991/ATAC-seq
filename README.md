## Aims
This repository has been made to be used as a starting base for your own ATAC-Seq analysis.

The file `ATACseq.ipynb` presents analyses allowing you to go from raw fastq files up to called ATAC-Seq peaks. This is a jupyter notebook prepared with a small example which your personnal machine should be able to run.

Similarly, the file `differential_binding.ipynb` presents a comparison study between several ATAC-Seq samples, run with edgeR in R. This is also a jupyter notebook which uses the files generated by the small example in the previous Jupyter Notebook

Please adapt it for your personnal uses.
