Please use the fournished Conda environments


## Questions and tools to ask to Delara

- Data example we can use (2 conditions, limited number of reads and chromosomes, several files so we can combine the reads)
- Organism used
- Genomes version used
- Why do you want it ? (To help or to complement the paper)
- Versions of each tools used (If just to help we can change them)
- Why samtools 1.2 ?
- What type of machine did you run it on ?
- Why bowtie2 and not another aligner ?
- What is the analysis you use EdgeR on ? (i'm guessing differential)
- How did you choose the trimmomatic options ?
- How did you write the original jupyter notebook ?
- What is the table 2 from Kate's paper

## Trimming

The fastq files are trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.39 to remove any adapter sequences in the reads caused by read through associated with DNA fragments shorter in size than the read length being sequenced.

This particular step need to be adapted depending on your exact data and need. We encourage you to read the [documentation](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/TrimmomaticManual_V0.32.pdf) of the Trimmomatic tool in order to find the best possible use for your case.

Let's breakdown the particular actions asked here:


* `ILLUMINACLIP:NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:30:10:1:true` corresponds more generally to `ILLUMINACLIP:<fastaWithAdaptersEtc>:<seed mismatches>:<palindrome clip threshold>:<simple clip threshold>`
  - `ILLUMINACLIP` we ask to cut adapters and other illumina sequence from the reads
  - `NexteraPE-PE.fa` We give infomations on the type of adaptors that have been used in the librairy preparation (here, Nextera Pair ended), the correspondant .fasta must be included
  - `2:30:10:1:true`
* `TRAILING:3`
* `SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15`

```{bash trimmomatic, eval=FALSE}
trimmomatic PE -threads 2 data/raw_reads/2_S2_R1_001.fastq.gz data/raw_reads/2_S2_R2_001.fastq.gz output/trimmed_files/2_S2_R1_trimmed.fastq output/trimmed_files/2_S2_R1_trimmed_unpaired.fastq output/trimmed_files/2_S2_R2_trimmed.fastq output/trimmed_files/2_S2_R2_trimmed_unpaired.fastq ILLUMINACLIP:data/adapters/NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:30:10:1:true TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15
```

## Alignement

This step must also be adapted to your particular experiment, namely the genomes used may vary.

Alignment is performed by bowtie2.4.4

### Bowtie2 Index

In order to align reads to genomes and particular cellular compartments (i.e. mithochodria), it is necessary to build a bowtie index for each of them and potential cofounders. In the end, only the reads mapping solely to the target of interests will be saved, which in our case means that the mithochondrial hits will be removed.

Bowtie2 necessitate and index to be build before alignment can be done. By default, the exact method used is choosen depending on the specificities of the machine doing the computation, please read the [documentation of bowtie2-build](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#the-bowtie2-build-indexer) for further informations, and be carefull when repeating a study on different machines.

If you already have a bowtie index built for this type of alignment, this step can be skipped.

```{bash bowtie2-index,  eval=FALSE}
bowtie2-build chr1.fa,chr2.fa,chr3.fa,chr4.fa,chr5.fa,chr6.fa,chr7.fa,chr8.fa,chr9.fa,chr10.fa,chr11.fa,chr12.fa,chr13.fa,chr14.fa,chr15.fa,chr16.fa,chr17.fa,chr18.fa,chr19.fa mouse_vn_chrN

bowtie2-build chrM.fa mouse_vn_chrM.fa

```

### Alignement

#### Removal of Mitochondrial DNA

Let's breakdown the various options used

* `-p 4` We are using 4 threads for alignement. This option can also be accessed via `--threads`
* `-X 2000` The maximum fragment length accepted between paired end. This number should be adapted depending on your sequencing protocol.
* `--very-sensitive` preset option corresponding to `-D 20 -R 3 -N 0 -L 20 -i S,1,0.50`
* `-x` shows bowtie index
*  `-1 and -2` The input fastq files in the case of paired end alignment
*  `-S` File in which to write the output SAM file of the aligned reads. This file will not be usefull to us later, but printing it allows us to use less memory
*  `--un-conc` We only keep pairs that DIDn't aligned on mitochondrial genome

for more informations and option, you can run `bowtie2 --help`

```{bash mitochondria-removind, eval=FALSE}
bowtie2 -p 4 -X 2000 --very-sensitive -x data/genomes/GRCm39/mouse_vn_chrM.fa -1 output/trimmed_files/2_S2_R1_trimmed.fastq -2 output/trimmed_files/2_S2_R2_trimmed.fastq -S temp_files/A_tempM.sam --un-conc temp_files/2_S2_fastq
```

This command also generate some files that must be deleted, namely `temp_files/A_tempM.sam`, we still keep it as an output because removing it make the alignment much more memory heavy.

#### Alignment on chromosomal genome

Bowtie2 ask files to be compressed before alignment, so we have to zip the files. We also remove the sam files that

```{bash zipping-files, eval = FALSE}
gzip temp_files/2_S2_fastq.1 temp_files/2_S2_fastq.2
rm temp_files/A_tempM.sam
```

We align on the chromosomal genome, in a very similar maner as the previous alignment

```{bash aligning-non-mitochodrial, eval=FALSE }
bowtie2 -p 4 -X 2000 --very-sensitive -x data/genomes/GRCm39/mouse_vn_chrN -1 temp_files/2_S2_fastq.1.gz -2 temp_files/2_S2_fastq.2.gz -S output/aligned_files/2_S2_aligned_nuclear.sam
```

```{bash removing-temp-files, eval=FALSE}
rm temp_files/2_S2_fastq.*
```

Change of type of file, we want the sam output to be made as a sorted and indexed bam files.

```{bash sam-to-bash, eval=FALSE}
samtools view -b --threads 3 output/aligned_files/2_S2_aligned_nuclear.sam -b -o output/aligned_files/2_S2_aligned_nuclear_unsorted.bam
```

Sorting the bam file

```{bash sorting-and-indexing-bam-outputs, eval=TRUE}
samtools sort output/aligned_files/2_S2_aligned_nuclear_unsorted.bam output/aligned_files/2_S2_aligned_nuclear_sorted.bam
samtools index output/aligned_files/2_S2_aligned_nuclear_sorted.bam
```

## Quality Controls

SAMtools flag are a way SAMtools trackes several information about a read, such as wether it is paired. Here we check the repartition of those flags within our sample
